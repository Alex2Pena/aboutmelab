        <h1> Welcome to my about me page!</h1>

        <p>A quick bio: My name is Anthony Cunningham. I grew up all over the United States and joined the military when I was 21. I love video games and scary movies, and my favorite type of food is Japanese.</p>

        <ul> My favorite games

            <li div id="league" style="padding-top: 3mm;">League of Legends</li>
            <li div id="warcraft" style="padding-top: 3mm;">World of Warcraft</li>
            <li div id="dragon" style="padding-top: 3mm;">Dungeons and Dragons</li>
            <li div id="witcher" style="padding-top: 3mm;">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>

        </ul>

        <p>My education and goals: I had a normal education, but did not go to college right after I finished high school. I worked for a landscaping company building fences and decks. My current goals are to hopefully make it all the way through to 401 and become a proud Javascript developer!</p>
